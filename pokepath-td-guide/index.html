                                <h2>Overview</h2>
                                <p>PokePath TD is a community-driven Pokémon-themed tower defense game that challenges players to build resilient defensive lines, manage resources, and exploit type advantages to survive increasingly difficult waves. This guide covers everything from starter strategies to advanced meta tactics so you can reliably progress through routes, maximize score, and build optimized teams.</p>

                                <p>Whether you're new to tower defense or migrating from other Pokémon fangames, the following sections provide a structured path: learn the core mechanics, understand route-specific counters, create scalable team builds, and apply advanced tips to climb leaderboards. The content is designed for both quick answers and deep dives — use the table of contents (H2 headings) to jump where needed.</p>

                                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                                <p>These are the high-level systems you need to master to win consistently:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Type Matchups and Synergy</strong> — Build teams that cover common threats and support each other with complementary abilities.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Route Awareness</strong> — Each route has predictable enemy mixes and terrain modifiers; adapt your composition accordingly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Economy & Upgrades</strong> — Efficient resource use and upgrade timing separate average players from experts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ability Management</strong> — Many units have game-changing abilities; prioritize unlocking those that scale best.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Step-by-step guide / list / builds</h2>
                                <h3>Beginner (First 10 runs)</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Choose a safe route:</strong> Start with Route 1 (Grasslands) to learn enemy patterns and cheap counters.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Core units:</strong> Pick 2–3 versatile units (one tank, one damage dealer, one utility).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Placement basics:</strong> Frontline tanks at choke points, ranged DPS behind them to focus fire and protect key units.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Upgrade pacing:</strong> Prioritize upgrades that unlock key abilities over small stat bumps early on.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h3>Intermediate (Wave 20–60)</h3>
                                <p>At this stage you'll need route counters and secondary synergies:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Introduce area-control units for crowd waves and lane splitting.</li>
                                    <li>Save for mid-tier upgrade thresholds (ability unlocks) that shift unit roles.</li>
                                    <li>Identify a single scaling DPS that benefits most from late-game investment.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Advanced Builds (Late game and competitive)</h3>
                                <p>Advanced players optimize for resource efficiency and redundancy:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Multi-layer defense:</strong> Overlapping fields of damage and utility across zones to handle mixed waves.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ability combos:</strong> Chain crowd-control with burst windows for boss waves and elite enemies.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Late-game scaling:</strong> Invest in units with exponential damage or unique mechanics that scale with levels.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Tips & tricks</h2>
                                <p>High-impact tips that produce immediate improvements:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Pre-wave positioning:</strong> Move non-anchored units slightly before important waves to optimize target priority.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sell and re-buy:</strong> When a unit falls off, selling and replacing it can be more efficient than half-hearted upgrades.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Conserve resources:</strong> Keep a small emergency reserve for surprise mechanics or boss counters.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use terrain:</strong> Exploit choke points and elevation bonuses to amplify DPS and control effects.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Iterative testing:</strong> Record runs or take notes on failure points to tune team composition.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>For a quick experiment while <a href="https://pokepath-game.github.io/pokepath-td/" class="menu-link">playing PokePath TD online</a>, try the Balanced Core template on Route 1 and observe how slight placement changes affect wave survival.</p>

                                <h2>On-page SEO notes (how this guide is optimized)</h2>
                                <p>This page is built to satisfy search intent for “PokePath TD guide” and long-tail queries like “PokePath TD routes guide”, “best teams PokePath TD”, and “how to beat boss waves PokePath TD”. Clear H2/H3 sections map to user intent categories — overview, features, step-by-step, tips, and FAQ — increasing topical relevance and helping Google understand the page hierarchy.</p>

                                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                                <h3>What's the best starting unit?</h3>
                                <p>A: For beginners, choose a balanced DPS like Charizard (if available) and pair it with a tank like Snorlax to absorb early damage. For route-specific starters consult our Tier List page.</p>

                                <h3>Should I always pick the recommended team?</h3>
                                <p>A: Recommended teams provide a stable baseline, but you should adapt to the route and your available upgrades. The Best Teams page contains flexible comps tuned per route.</p>

                                <h3>How do I recover from a bad early game?</h3>
                                <p>A: Sell underperforming units, consolidate upgrades into one or two scaling units, and play defensively until you regain resource momentum.</p>

                                <h3>Where can I find more detailed unit stats?</h3>
                                <p>A: The Wiki contains a complete database of units, abilities, and enemies for micro-optimization and precise matchup planning.</p>

                                <h2>Advanced strategy examples and sample builds</h2>
                                <p>Below are concrete example strategies that show how unit choices, upgrade order, and placement interact in practice. These examples assume an intermediate player familiar with basic mechanics.</p>

                                <h3>Sample Build — Balanced Rush (Route 1)</h3>
                                <p>Early game: Place a tank at the primary choke and a mid-cost ranged DPS behind it. Prioritize a single damage upgrade on the DPS by wave 8. Mid game: Add an area-control unit to handle grouped spawns and a secondary support that provides slow or heal. Late game: Convert one support into a high-scaling DPS and max the frontline tank's survivability. This build excels at consistent scaling while maintaining crowd control.</p>

                                <h3>Sample Build — Control & Burst (Route 3 Volcanic)</h3>
                                <p>Early game: Invest in area-control and one strong anti-fire unit. Mid game: Lock in a secondary DPS with elemental advantage against fire and purchase the ability upgrades that boost burst damage. Late game: Time your burst abilities to coincide with boss waves; use control units to freeze or slow to maximize burst uptime. This approach favors controlled windows of high damage rather than steady output.</p>

                                <h3>Upgrade Ordering Guidelines</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Priority 1 — Core DPS ability unlocks:</strong> Abilities that change a unit's role are typically higher value than raw stats.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Priority 2 — Frontline survivability:</strong> Invest in HP and defensive upgrades on tanks to keep your damage dealers alive longer.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Priority 3 — Utility thresholds:</strong> Unlocking a utility's second tier (e.g., larger slow radius) can shift the balance during mid-game waves.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Applying these sample templates and upgrade rules will help you form a repeatable plan during runs. Always adapt based on the exact wave composition and the units you draw or unlock during the match.</p>

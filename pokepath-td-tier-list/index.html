                                <h1>PokePath TD Tier List – Best Pokémon Ranking</h1>

                                <h2>Overview</h2>
                                <p>Welcome to the comprehensive PokePath TD tier list! This ranking system evaluates every Pokémon's performance across different routes, game modes, and situations. Our tier list is regularly updated based on community data, patch changes, and extensive testing to provide you with the most accurate rankings possible.</p>

                                <p>The tier system ranges from S-tier (the absolute best) to D-tier (situational or weak). Each Pokémon is evaluated based on damage output, survivability, utility, type advantages, and overall viability in competitive play. Remember that tiers can shift with game updates and meta changes.</p>

                                <p>Tip: if you want to validate counters or try compositions quickly, you can <a href="https://pokepath-game.github.io/pokepath-td/" class="menu-link">Play PokePath TD Online</a> and test units directly in the route environment.</p>

                                <h2>Key Features of Our Tier List</h2>
                                <p>What makes our tier list comprehensive and reliable?</p>

                                <h3>Data-Driven Rankings</h3>
                                <p>Our rankings are based on extensive playtesting, statistical analysis, and community feedback rather than personal opinions.</p>

                                <h2>Advanced usage and testing methodology</h2>
                                <p>To use this tier list effectively, follow a testing approach: select a few candidate units from top tiers, create a baseline team, and run controlled experiments altering only one variable at a time (e.g., swap a single unit or change upgrade order). Track wave progression and resource efficiency to validate real-world performance.</p>

                                <h2>Common mistakes when using tier lists</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Copying meta without adjusting for upgrades or route specifics.</li>
                                    <li>Over-relying on single-unit power without redundancy.</li>
                                    <li>Failing to adapt after patch changes — review this list after balance updates.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                                <h3>How often is the tier list updated?</h3>
                                <p>We update approximately every 2–4 weeks or after significant patches.</p>

                                <h3>Can I rely solely on tiers?</h3>
                                <p>Tiers are a guide — always test units in your team context and for the route you plan to run.</p>

                                <h2>Detailed unit breakdown (examples)</h2>
                                <p>Below we provide more granular notes for a subset of notable units — useful when you must choose between close-tier options.</p>
                                <h3>Charizard — S-Tier notes</h3>
                                <p>Charizard offers high single-target and area damage, with aerial mobility allowing flexible placement. Upgrade priority: area damage > critical hit chance > attack speed. Pair with AOE controllers to handle swarms while Charizard focuses heavy damage on elites.</p>

                                <h3>Blastoise — S-Tier notes</h3>
                                <p>Blastoise excels at sustained area damage and defensive utility. Prioritize cooldown reduction and area radius upgrades. In routes with clustered spawns, Blastoise often outperforms single-target DPS due to continuous AOE pressure.</p>

                                <h3>Metagross — S-Tier notes</h3>
                                <p>Metagross is a late-game powerhouse with strong defenses and burst attacks. Use as anchor and invest in survivability first; then unlock heavy attack upgrades to punch through elite shields.</p>

                                <h2>Tier list maintenance and community contributions</h2>
                                <p>This tier list benefits from active community feedback. If you find a unit performing differently than listed, please collect run data (waves survived, build used, upgrades) and submit it to our repository or forum. We aggregate community submissions to detect meta shifts and update rankings accordingly.</p>

                                <h2>Using tier lists to plan progression</h2>
                                <p>When planning long-term progression across multiple runs, use the tier list to prioritize unit acquisition and upgrade resources. A simple progression plan:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Secure one S-tier anchor for your preferred route.</li>
                                    <li>Complement with an A-tier support that fills a primary gap (AOE/control/heal).</li>
                                    <li>Build a B-tier flexible slot for situational needs.</li>
                                    <li>Review and rotate units after every 10 runs to incorporate experience and new unlocks.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Practical tip: while <a href="https://pokepath-game.github.io/pokepath-td/" class="menu-link">playing PokePath TD online</a>, test tier swaps one at a time to measure real impact on wave survival.</p>

                                <h2>Final notes</h2>
                                <p>Tiers provide a starting point — your execution, positioning, and timing determine ultimate success. Use the tier list in tandem with the Best Teams and Guide pages for complete preparation. Good luck and happy defending!</p>
                                <h2>Comparative examples and policy</h2>
                                <p>When two units appear comparable on paper, compare them across three axes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Raw output per cost</strong> — how much damage or utility per gold invested?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Scaling curve</strong> — which unit improves more when fully upgraded?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Team fit</strong> — does the unit enable or require other units to perform?</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Data collection and voting</h2>
                                <p>We rely on community-submitted run data and developer patch notes. If you contribute data, include: route name, wave reached, team list, upgrades purchased, and notable events (e.g., boss mechanics). Aggregated data drives tier adjustments.</p>

                                <h2>How to read the table (examples)</h2>
                                <p>A unit listed as A-tier on Route 2 but B-tier on Route 5 indicates strong matchups in rocky terrains but weaknesses in mixed-element forests. Use such notes to substitute units when route changes or if you lack S-tier options.</p>

                                <h2>Editorial notes and contribution guidelines</h2>
                                <p>Maintainers review submissions weekly. To suggest changes, file a report including reproducible steps and relevant logs. Simple opinions without data are logged but weighted lower. We prioritize submissions with objective metrics (win rate, average waves survived, resource efficiency).</p>

                                <h2>Unit archetype examples</h2>
                                <p>Understanding archetypes helps you map units to roles quickly:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Anchor tanks</strong> — High HP and threat control, slow scaling but essential early.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Scaling DPS</strong> — Low early power but high late-game return with upgrades.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Utility controllers</strong> — Provide slows, stuns, or debuffs that multiply team effectiveness.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hybrid supports</strong> — Healers that also contribute damage or buffs.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Closing advice</h2>
                                <p>Use this tier list as a strategic map, not a strict prescription. The best players combine meta knowledge with in-run adaptability. Bookmark the Best Teams and Guide pages for templates and practical run plans, and check the Wiki for precise unit stats when micro-optimizing your builds.</p>
